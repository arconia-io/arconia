## üöÄ&nbsp; Quick Start

### Pre-Requisites

* Java 21+
* [Spring CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/installation.html)

### Getting Started

Using the Spring CLI, you can easily bootstrap a new Spring Boot application using the Arconia framework.

First, add the Arconia Spring catalog providing the project templates.

```shell
spring project-catalog add arconia https://github.com/arconia-io/arconia
```

Then, create a new Spring Boot project for building a multitenant web application.

```shell
spring boot new myapp arconia-web
```

Finally, navigate to the `myapp` folder and run the Spring Boot application.

```shell
cd myapp
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can now call the application as one of the valid tenants (`dukes` or `beans`).
This example uses [httpie](https://httpie.io) to send HTTP requests.

```shell
http :8080/ X-TenantId:dukes
```
