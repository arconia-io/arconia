:description: Learn how to get started with Arconia OpenTelemetry for Spring Boot applications.

Arconia provides unified observability for Spring Boot applications, combining full support for https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] API, SDK, and Instrumentation with full support for https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] API and Instrumentation. The goal is to provide a single, unified observability solution for Spring Boot applications that can give you the best of both worlds: the standardization and ubiquity of OpenTelemetry and the robustness and stability of Micrometer.

TIP: If you're currently using OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter or Spring Boot OpenTelemetry/OTLP, check out our xref:migration.adoc[Migration Guides] for a seamless migration to Arconia OpenTelemetry.

== Quick Start

Let's see how you can get started with Arconia OpenTelemetry in your Spring Boot application.

TIP: You can refer to our https://github.com/arconia-io/arconia-examples/tree/main/arconia-opentelemetry/observability-signals[sample application] for a minimal example of how Arconia OpenTelemetry works.

=== Dependencies

If you already have a Spring Boot application and want to add OpenTelemetry support, you can add the Arconia OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter dependency to your project. This will automatically configure OpenTelemetry, Micrometer, and Spring Boot Actuator for you. 

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.arconia:arconia-opentelemetry-spring-boot-starter'
}
----

Arconia publishes a BOM (Bill of Materials) that you can use to manage the version of the Arconia OpenTelemetry libraries. Whether not required, it is recommended to use the BOM to ensure that all dependencies are compatible.

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "io.arconia:arconia-bom:{page-component-version}"
	}
}
----

=== Dev Services

Arconia Dev Services provide zero-code integrations for services your application depends on, both at development and test time, relying on the power of https://testcontainers.com[Testcontainers] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.testcontainers[Spring Boot].

When working with OpenTelemetry, you can use the Grafana LGTM Dev Service to automatically start a full Grafana observability platform based on OpenTelemetry, giving you the possibility to visualize and explore your application's telemetry data during development and testing.

To enable the Grafana LGTM Dev Service, add the following dependency to your project.

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
	testAndDevelopmentOnly "io.arconia:arconia-dev-services-lgtm"
}
----

=== Running the Application

When using the Arconia Dev Services, you can keep running your application as you normally would. The Dev Services will automatically start when you run your application.

include::ROOT:partial$app-run.adoc[]

NOTE: Unlike the lower-level Testcontainers support in Spring Boot, Arconia doesn't require special tasks to run your application when using Dev Services (`./gradlew bootTestRun` or `./mvnw spring-boot:test-run`) nor requires you to define a separate `@SpringBootApplication` class for configuring Testcontainers.

The application logs will show you the URL where you can access the Grafana observability platform.

[source,logs]
----
...o.t.grafana.LgtmStackContainer: Access to the Grafana dashboard: http://localhost:38125
----

NOTE: Learn more about the xref:dev-services:lgtm.adoc[Grafana LGTM Dev Service] in the dedicated section.

== Configuring Observability

The Arconia OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter provides sensible defaults for configuring observability signals. By default, logs, metrics, and traces are enabled and exported via OTLP to an OpenTelemetry-compatible backend.

You can disable individual observability signals or even disable the entire OpenTelemetry support via configuration properties.

.Observability Signals Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description

|`arconia.otel.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether OpenTelemetry SDK support should be enabled.

|`arconia.otel.logs.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether support for OpenTelemetry logs is enabled.

|`arconia.otel.metrics.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether support for OpenTelemetry metrics is enabled.

|`arconia.otel.traces.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether support for OpenTelemetry traces is enabled.
|===

== Exporting Telemetry

By default, all observability signals are exported via OTLP. You can change the type of the exporter in use for each observability signal. If you set the exporter type to `none`, the corresponding signal will be disabled from exporting.

.Exporter Type Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description
|	`arconia.otel.logs.exporter.type`
|	`otlp`
|	The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for logs. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|	`arconia.otel.metrics.exporter.type`
|	`otlp`
|	The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for metrics. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|	`arconia.otel.traces.exporter.type`
|	`otlp`
|	The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for traces. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|===

=== OTLP

Global properties are available to configure the OTLP exporters for logs, metrics, and traces.

.OTLP Exporter Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.compression`
|	`gzip`
|	Compression type to use for OTLP requests. Options: `none`, `gzip`.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.connect-timeout`
|	`10s`
|	The maximum waiting time for the exporter to establish a connection to the endpoint.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint`
|	`http://localhost:4317` (gPRC) or `http://localhost:4318` (HTTP)
|	The endpoint to which telemetry data will be sent.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.headers`
|	-
|	Additional headers to include in each request to the endpoint.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.metrics`
|	`false`
|	Whether to generate metrics for the exporter itself.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.protocol`
|	`http-protobuf`
|	Transport protocol to use for OTLP requests. Options: `grpc`, `http-protobuf`.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.timeout`
|	`10s`
|	The maximum waiting time for the exporter to send each telemetry batch.
|	`arconia.otel.exporter.memory-mode`
|	`reusable-data`
|	Whether to reuse objects to reduce allocation or work with immutable data structures. Options: `reusable-data`, `immutable-data`.
|===

You can override any of these properties for each observability signal using the `arconia.otel.<signal>.exporter.*` prefix, where `<signal>` is one of `logs`, `metrics`, or `traces`. For more details, refer to the dedicated documentation for xref:logs.adoc[Logs], xref:metrics.adoc[Metrics], and xref:traces.adoc[Traces].

==== HTTP

By default, the OpenTelemetry SDK uses HTTP/Protobuf for OTLP communication. In particular, it relies on the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/sdk/#senders[JDK Http Client] to send telemetry data to the endpoint.

==== gRPC

You can switch to gRPC by changing the `arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.protocol` property to `grpc`. Additionally, you need to add the following dependencies:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
  implementation "io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-sender-grpc-managed-channel"
  implementation "io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded:1.71.0"
}
----

NOTE: The https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/sdk/#senders[`opentelemetry-exporter-sender-grpc-managed-channel`] requires a transport implementation. The `grpc-netty-shaded` dependency is one choice, but you can use any other gRPC transport implementation that fits your needs.

=== Console

Instead of OTLP, you can use the console exporter to print the telemetry data to the console. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes. Besides setting the exporter type to `console` for the observability signals you want to export, you also need to add the following dependency:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
	implementation "io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-logging"
}
----

WARNING: This exporter option is not recommended for production.
