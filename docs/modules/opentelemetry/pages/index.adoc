=== Dev Services

xref:dev-services:index.adoc[Arconia Dev Services] streamline your development workflow by automatically provisioning external services your application depends on during development and testing. No manual setup is required.

With Arconia OpenTelemetry, you can leverage the xref:dev-services:lgtm.adoc[Grafana LGTM Dev Service] to automatically start a complete Grafana observability platform based on OpenTelemetry, allowing you to visualize and explore your application's telemetry data during development and testing.

To enable the Grafana LGTM Dev Service, add the following dependency to your project:

[tabs]
======
Gradle::
+
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    testAndDevelopmentOnly "io.arconia:arconia-dev-services-lgtm"

=== Running the Application

You can run your Spring Boot application using your preferred method.

include::ROOT:partial$app-run.adoc[]

If you have enabled the Grafana LGTM Dev Service, Arconia will automatically start a Grafana instance pre-configured to accept OpenTelemetry logs, metrics, and traces from your application when running in development or test mode.

NOTE: By default, when running the application in development mode, the Grafana LGTM Dev Service will be shared across multiple applications so that you can have a single observability platform for all your applications running in your development environment.

The application logs will show you the URL where you can access the Grafana observability platform and start exploring your application's telemetry data.

NOTE: Learn more about the xref:dev-services:lgtm.adoc[Grafana LGTM Dev Service] in the dedicated documentation.

== Enabling/Disabling Telemetry

The Arconia OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter provides sensible defaults for configuring observability signals. By default, logs, metrics, and traces are enabled and exported via OTLP to an OpenTelemetry-compatible backend.

You can disable individual observability signals or even disable the entire OpenTelemetry support via configuration properties.

.Observability Signals Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description

|`arconia.otel.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether OpenTelemetry support should be enabled.

|`arconia.otel.logs.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether support for OpenTelemetry logs is enabled.

|`arconia.otel.metrics.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether support for OpenTelemetry metrics is enabled.

|`arconia.otel.traces.enabled`
|`true`
|Whether support for OpenTelemetry traces is enabled.
|===

== Exporting Telemetry

By default, all observability signals are exported via OTLP. If you set the exporter type to `none`, the observability signals will be disabled from exporting.

.Exporter Type Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description
|`arconia.otel.exporter.type`
|`otlp`
|The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for observability signals. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|===

You can change the type of the exporter in use for each observability signal using the `arconia.otel.<signal>.exporter.type` property, where `<signal>` is one of `logs`, `metrics`, or `traces`.

.Specific Exporter Type Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description
|`arconia.otel.logs.exporter.type`
|_(inherited from arconia.otel.exporter.type)_
|The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for logs. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|`arconia.otel.metrics.exporter.type`
|_(inherited from arconia.otel.exporter.type)_
|The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for metrics. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|`arconia.otel.traces.exporter.type`
|_(inherited from arconia.otel.exporter.type)_
|The type of OpenTelemetry exporter to use for traces. Options: `console`, `otlp`, `none`.
|===

=== OTLP

Global properties are available to configure the OTLP exporters for logs, metrics, and traces.

.OTLP Exporter Configuration Properties
|===
|Property |Default |Description
|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.compression`
|`gzip`
|Compression type to use for OTLP requests. Options: `none`, `gzip`.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.connect-timeout`
|`10s`
|The maximum waiting time for the exporter to establish a connection to the endpoint.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint`
|`http://localhost:4317` (gPRC) or `http://localhost:4318` (HTTP)
|The endpoint to which telemetry data will be sent.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.headers`
|-
|Additional headers to include in each request to the endpoint.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.metrics`
|`false`
|Whether to generate metrics for the exporter itself.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.protocol`
|`http-protobuf`
|Transport protocol to use for OTLP requests. Options: `grpc`, `http-protobuf`.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.timeout`
|`10s`
|The maximum waiting time for the exporter to send each telemetry batch.

|`arconia.otel.exporter.memory-mode`
|`reusable-data`
|Whether to reuse objects to reduce allocation or work with immutable data structures. Options: `reusable-data`, `immutable-data`.
|===

You can override any of these properties for each observability signal using the `arconia.otel.<signal>.exporter.*` prefix, where `<signal>` is one of `logs`, `metrics`, or `traces`. For more details, refer to the dedicated documentation for xref:logs.adoc[Logs], xref:metrics.adoc[Metrics], and xref:traces.adoc[Traces].

==== HTTP

By default, the OpenTelemetry SDK uses HTTP/Protobuf for OTLP communication. In particular, it relies on the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/sdk/#senders[JDK Http Client] to send telemetry data to the endpoint.

==== gRPC

You can switch to gRPC by changing the `arconia.otel.exporter.otlp.protocol` property to `grpc`. Additionally, you need to add the following dependencies:

[tabs]
======
Gradle::
+
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation "io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-sender-grpc-managed-channel"
    runtimeOnly "io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded"
}
----

Maven::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-sender-grpc-managed-channel</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
    <artifactId>grpc-netty-shaded</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
======

NOTE: The https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/sdk/#senders[`opentelemetry-exporter-sender-grpc-managed-channel`] requires a transport implementation. The `grpc-netty-shaded` dependency is one choice, but you can use any other gRPC transport implementation that fits your needs.

=== Console

Instead of OTLP, you can use the console exporter to print the telemetry data to the console. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes. Besides setting the exporter type to `console` for the observability signals you want to export, you also need to add the following dependency:

[tabs]
======
Gradle::
+
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation "io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-logging"
}
----

Maven::
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-logging</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
======

WARNING: This exporter option is not recommended for production.

NOTE: The console exporter doesn't support exporting metrics defined using the Micrometer APIs when using the Micrometer Metrics Registry OTLP module instead of the OpenTelemetry Micrometer Metrics Bridge.

== OpenTelemetry Environment Variables

== Comparisons

Arconia provides unified observability for Spring Boot applications, combining full support for https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] API, SDK, and Instrumentation with full support for https://micrometer.io[Micrometer] API and Instrumentation. The goal is to provide a single, unified observability solution for Spring Boot applications that can give you the best of both worlds: the standardization and ubiquity of OpenTelemetry and the robustness and stability of Micrometer.

image::arconia-otel.png[Arconia provides full support for OpenTelemetry and Micrometer, width=500]

The main reason why Arconia OpenTelemetry exists is that no other option provides this level of integration and support for both OpenTelemetry and Micrometer in a single, unified solution. This section compares Arconia OpenTelemetry with other solutions available in the Spring Boot ecosystem (see the comparison table below).

== Arconia OpenTelemetry vs OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter

The https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter[OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter] is built on top of the OpenTelemetry Java SDK and Instrumentation libraries. It provides support for OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs, including logging, metrics, and tracing.

A key difference between Arconia OpenTelemetry and the OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter is that the latter doesn't re-use most of the existing, stable Micrometer instrumentation available across the Spring and Java ecosystem. Each Spring library comes with built-in instrumentation based on the Micrometer Observation API. By not re-using the existing Micrometer instrumentation, the OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter misses out on a significant amount of telemetry data which needs to be implemented and maintained separately by the OpenTelemetry community. Additionally, the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation follows the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions, most of which are not stable and may change over time, leading to potential breaking changes in the instrumentation.

== Arconia OpenTelemetry vs Spring Boot OpenTelemetry

The https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/observability.html#actuator.observability.opentelemetry[Spring Boot] project provides observability based on Micrometer with partial support for exporting telemetry for OpenTelemetry. For logs, it supports the OpenTelemetry Logging API but no bridges are provided to re-use existing logging instrumentation. For traces, it supports the OpenTelemetry Tracing API via a bridge from Micrometer Tracing. For metrics, Spring Boot doesn't provide support for OpenTelemetry Metrics API. Instead, it offers an option to export Micrometer metrics via OTLP using the Micrometer Metrics Registry OTLP module.

A key difference between Arconia OpenTelemetry and Spring Boot is that the latter doesn't provide full support for OpenTelemetry APIs, SDKs, and Environment Variables. In particular, by not supporting the OpenTelemetry Metrics API, Spring Boot misses out on the ability to collect metrics using the standard OpenTelemetry APIs and instrumentation which is used by some Java libraries. Additionally, configuration for each observability signal is segregated rather than unified under a single OpenTelemetry configuration model to benefit from consistency and common defaults across all signals.
