= What's New in Arconia {page-component-version}

Arconia {page-component-version} provides a number of new features and enhancements. This page includes the highlights of the release, but you can also check out the full https://github.com/arconia-io/arconia/releases[release notes] for more details about each new feature and bug fix.

We provide an automated way to upgrade your project to the latest version of Arconia, which is described in the xref:upgrading-arconia.adoc[Upgrading Arconia] documentation.

== Docling

* The Docling Java SDK used by the xref:integrations:docling.adoc[Arconia Docling] integration has moved all classes from the `ai.docling.api.core` to the `ai.docling.core` package, and from the `ai.docling.api.serve` to the `ai.docling.serve.api` package. If you follow the instructions described in the xref:upgrading-arconia.adoc[Upgrading Arconia] documentation, this refactoring will be applied automatically.
* The `DoclingServeApi` now includes two additional APIs to perform document chunking as part of a conversion process. There are two chunking strategies available: hierarchical chunking (`chunkSourceWithHierarchicalChunker()`) and hybrid chunking (`chunkSourceWithHybridChunker()`). You can read more about Docling chunking in the https://docling-project.github.io/docling/concepts/chunking[official documentation].
* The `arconia.docling.url` property has been renamed to `arconia.docling.base-url`.

== Generative AI

* A Docling-based implementation of Spring AI's `DocumentReader` API (`DoclingDocumentReader`) has been introduced to use Docling with Spring AI to read, convert, and chunk documents so that they can be stored in a vector store and queried in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Check out xref:generative-ai:docling-document-reader.adoc[Docling Document Reader] for more information.
