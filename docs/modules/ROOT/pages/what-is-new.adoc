We provide an automated way to upgrade your project to the latest version of Arconia, which is described in the xref:upgrading-arconia.adoc[Upgrading Arconia] documentation.

== Dev Services

* A new Dev Service for xref:dev-services:otel-collector.adoc[OpenTelemetry Collector] has been added, ready to work with xref:opentelemetry:index.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry].
* The implementation of the xref:dev-services:redis.adoc[Redis Dev Service] has been changed from the Testcontainers Redis module (currently unmaintained) to the core Testcontainers library. This will not change the behavior of the Dev Service, and it's transparent to users.

== OpenTelemetry

* Exemplars for OpenTelemetry metrics are now stable. Support is enabled by default and can be customized via the `arconia.otel.metrics.exemplars.*` configuration properties. See xref:opentelemetry:metrics.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry Metrics] for more information.
