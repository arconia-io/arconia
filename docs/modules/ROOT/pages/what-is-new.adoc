Arconia {page-component-version} provides a number of new features and enhancements. This page includes the highlights of the release, but you can also check out the full https://github.com/arconia-io/arconia/releases[release notes] for more details about each new feature and bug fix.

We provide an automated way to upgrade your project to the latest version of Arconia, which is described in the xref:upgrading-arconia.adoc[Upgrading Arconia] documentation.

== Dev Services

* A new Dev Service for xref:dev-services:otel-collector.adoc[OpenTelemetry Collector] has been added, ready to work with xref:opentelemetry:index.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry].
* The implementation of the xref:dev-services:docling.adoc[Docling Dev Service] has been changed from a custom implementation to the new [Docling Java Testcontainers](https://docling-project.github.io/docling-java/dev/testcontainers/) module. This will not change the behavior of the Dev Service, and it's transparent to users.
* The implementation of the xref:dev-services:redis.adoc[Redis Dev Service] has been changed from the Testcontainers Redis module (currently unmaintained) to the core Testcontainers library. This will not change the behavior of the Dev Service, and it's transparent to users.

== Docling

* The xref:integrations:docling.adoc[Arconia Docling] integration has been refactored to use the new https://docling-project.github.io/docling-java[Docling Java] project to which Arconia contributed by upstreaming the core functionality that was previously implemented in the framework. This change improves the portability of the Docling integration by adopting a common API used across the Java ecosystem.
* The `DoclingClient` API has been replaced by the `DoclingServeApi`, which is the new common API provided by the Docling Java project. The new API offers the same functionality as the previous one. You can read more about it in the https://docling-project.github.io/docling-java/dev/docling-serve/serve-api/[Docling Serve API documentation].
* The `ConvertDocumentRequest`, `ConvertDocumentResponse`, `ConvertDocumentOptions`, and `HealthCheckResponse` classes have been replaced by equivalent classes in the new Docling Java project. They offer the same functionality as the previous ones, including builder methods for easier instantiation. However, they use getters and setters instead of record-style accessors.

== OpenTelemetry

* Exemplars for OpenTelemetry metrics are now stable. Support is enabled by default and can be customized via the `arconia.otel.metrics.exemplars.*` configuration properties. See xref:opentelemetry:metrics.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry Metrics] for more information.
