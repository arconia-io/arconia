== Docling

You can use the `DoclingClient` to interact with a Docling Server for converting various document formats including PDFs, Word documents, and web pages. Learn more about the integration in the xref:integrations:docling.adoc[Arconia Docling] documentation.
* A new Docling Dev Service has been introduced, which allows you to run Docling conveniently during development and testing and works great in combination with the new Arconia Docling module. Learn more about the Dev Service in the xref:dev-services:docling.adoc[Docling Dev Service] documentation.
