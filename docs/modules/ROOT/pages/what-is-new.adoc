== Docling

* The Docling Dev Service has been updated to use Docling Serve 1.2.0, and support has been extended for images from both GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/docling-project/docling-serve`) and Quay.io (`quay.io/docling-project/docling-serve`). By default, the Dev Service will use the GitHub Container Registry image.
