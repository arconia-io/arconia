= Upgrading Arconia

Arconia is currently in active development. We're working hard to improve it and appreciate your patience as we continue to refine the tool.

We're moving fast, and the APIs may change frequently, but we're committed to keeping the documentation up to date and make it easy to upgrade to the latest version.

In fact, we built a tool to help you upgrade your project to the latest version of Arconia automatically: the https://arconia.io/docs/arconia-cli/latest/[Arconia CLI].

Check out the https://arconia.io/docs/arconia-cli/latest/installation/[CLI documentation] for instructions on how to install it.

Then, run the following command to upgrade your project to the latest version of Arconia:

[source,shell]
----
arconia update framework
----

Under the hood, the Arconia CLI is using https://docs.openrewrite.org[OpenRewrite] to automate the upgrade process in a determinist and predictable way.
