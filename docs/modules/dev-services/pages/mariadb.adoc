= MariaDB Dev Service
:service-name: mariadb

When your application needs a relational database (such as when using Spring Data JDBC or Spring Data JPA), you can use the MariaDB Dev Service to automatically start a MariaDB database. This enables you to develop and test your application without having to manually start and manage a database server.
