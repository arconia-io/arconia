= Arize Phoenix
:service-name: phoenix

A service providing https://arize.com/docs/phoenix[Arize Phoenix], an AI Observability and Evaluation platform based on OpenTelemetry and OpenInference, for development and testing purposes.

It works with Spring Boot libraries that support OpenTelemetry, including:

* xref:opentelemetry:index.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry].

[NOTE]
====
The Dev Service for Arize Phoenix is mutually exclusive with the Dev Service for xref:lgtm.adoc[Grafana LGTM] and xref:otel-collector.adoc[OpenTelemetry Collector], as they all integrate with OpenTelemetry. If more than one of those Dev Services is included in the project dependencies, ensure you only enable one of them via configuration properties (`arconia.dev.services.<name>.enabled`).
