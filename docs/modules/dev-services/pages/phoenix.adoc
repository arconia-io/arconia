= Arize Phoenix
:service-name: phoenix

A service providing https://arize.com/docs/phoenix[Arize Phoenix], an AI Observability and Evaluation platform based on OpenTelemetry and OpenInference, for development and testing purposes.

It works with Spring Boot libraries that support OpenTelemetry, including:

* xref:opentelemetry:index.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry].

[NOTE]
====
Since Phoenix only supports OpenTelemetry traces, when the Dev Service is enabled, the export of OpenTelemetry logs and metrics is disabled unless explicitly configured.
====

[NOTE]
====
The Dev Service for Arize Phoenix is mutually exclusive with the Dev Service for xref:lgtm.adoc[Grafana LGTM] and xref:otel-collector.adoc[OpenTelemetry Collector], as they all integrate with OpenTelemetry. If more than one of those Dev Services is included in the project dependencies, ensure you only enable one of them via configuration properties (`arconia.dev.services.<name>.enabled`).
====

== Dependencies

include::partial$dependencies.adoc[]

== Running the Application

include::partial$running-application.adoc[]

By default, when running the application in dev mode, the Dev Service will be shared across multiple applications.

== Accessing Phoenix

The application logs will show you the URL where you can access the Arize Phoenix UI.

[source,logs]
----
...Phoenix UI: http://localhost:<port>
----

By default, traces are exported via OTLP using the HTTP/Protobuf format.

== Configuring the Dev Service

You can configure the Dev Service via configuration properties.

|===
|Property |Default |Description

|`arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.enabled`
| `true`
| Whether the dev service is enabled.

|`arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.image-name`
| `arizephoenix/phoenix`
| Full name of the container image used in the dev service.

|`arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.environment`
| `{}`
| Environment variables to set in the container.

| `[]`
| Network aliases to assign to the dev service container.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.port`
| `0`

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.resources`
| `[]`
| Resources from the classpath or host filesystem to copy into the container. They can be files or directories that will be copied to the specified destination path inside the container at startup and are immutable (read-only).

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.shared`
| `true`
| Whether the dev service is shared among applications. Only applicable in dev mode.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.startup-timeout`
| `30s`
| Maximum waiting time for the service to start.
