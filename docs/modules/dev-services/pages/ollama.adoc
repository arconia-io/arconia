= Ollama Dev Service
:service-name: ollama

A service providing an https://ollama.com[Ollama] model inference service for development and testing purposes.

It works with Spring Boot libraries that support Ollama, including:

* https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai[Spring AI]

NOTE: By default, the Ollama Dev Service is disabled since it might be resource-intensive, and running native Ollama might be more suitable for development. You can enable it globally or selectively for specific tests.
