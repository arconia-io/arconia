= RabbitMQ Dev Service
:service-name: rabbitmq

When your application needs a RabbitMQ message broker (such as when using Spring for RabbitMQ or Spring for RabbitMQ Streams), you can use the RabbitMQ Dev Service to automatically start a RabbitMQ instance. This enables you to develop and test your application without having to manually start and manage the RabbitMQ instance.
