= PostgreSQL Dev Service
:service-name: postgresql

When your application needs a relational database (such as when using Spring Data JDBC or Spring Data JPA), you can use the PostgreSQL Dev Service to start automatically a PostgreSQL database or one of its variants (such as PGVector when working with embeddings in LLM-powered applications). This enables you to develop and test your application without having to manually start and manage a database server.
