= Oracle XE Dev Service
:service-name: oracle-xe

When your application needs a relational database (such as when using Spring Data JDBC or Spring Data JPA), you can use the Oracle XE Dev Service to automatically start an Oracle XE database. This enables you to develop and test your application without having to manually start and manage a database server.
