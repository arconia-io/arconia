= Grafana LGTM
:service-name: lgtm

A service providing a Grafana LGTM observability platform based on OpenTelemetry for development and testing purposes. It consists of:

* https://grafana.com/oss/grafana[Grafana] for visualizing and exploring telemetry data.
* https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector[OpenTelemetry Collector] for collecting telemetry data from your application using OTLP.
* https://grafana.com/oss/loki[Grafana Loki] for storing and querying logs.
* https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] for storing and querying metrics.
* https://grafana.com/oss/tempo[Grafana Tempo] for storing and querying traces.

It works with Spring Boot libraries that support OpenTelemetry, including:

* xref:opentelemetry:index.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry].

[NOTE]
====
The Dev Service for Grafana LGTM is mutually exclusive with the Dev Service for xref:phoenix.adoc[Arize Phoenix], as both services integrate with OpenTelemetry. If both Dev Services are included in the project dependencies, ensure you disable one of them via configuration properties (`arconia.dev.services.lgtm.enabled` or `arconia.dev.services.phoenix.enabled`).

== Dependencies

include::partial$dependencies.adoc[]

== Running the Application

include::partial$running-application.adoc[]

By default, when running the application in development mode, the Dev Service will be shared across multiple applications.

== Accessing Grafana

The application logs will show you the URL where you can access the Grafana observability platform and information about logs, metrics, and traces being exported to the platform.

By default, logs, metrics, and traces are exported via OTLP using the HTTP/Protobuf format.

== Configuring the Dev Service

You can configure the Dev Service via configuration properties.

| `true`
| Whether the dev service is enabled.

|`arconia.dev.services.lgtm.image-name`
| `grafana/otel-lgtm`
| Full name of the container image used in the dev service.

|`arconia.dev.services.lgtm.environment`
| `{}`
| Environment variables to set in the container. Example: `ENABLE_LOGS_ALL: "true"`.
