= Docling Dev Service
:service-name: docling

A service providing a https://docling-project.github.io/docling[Docling] server for development and testing purposes.

It works with Spring Boot libraries that support Docling, including:

* xref:integrations:docling.adoc[Arconia Docling].

== Dependencies

include::partial$dependencies.adoc[]

== Running the Application

include::partial$running-application.adoc[]

By default, when running the application in development mode, the Dev Service will be shared across multiple applications.

Furthermore, the Dev Service is configured to expose the Docling UI on a specific port. The application logs will show you the URL where you can access that.
