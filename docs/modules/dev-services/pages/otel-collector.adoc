= OpenTelemetry Collector
:service-name: otel-collector

A service providing an https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector[OpenTelemetry Collector] for development and testing purposes.

It works with Spring Boot libraries that support OpenTelemetry, including:

* xref:opentelemetry:index.adoc[Arconia OpenTelemetry].

[NOTE]
====
The Dev Service for OpenTelemetry Collector is mutually exclusive with the Dev Service for xref:lgtm.adoc[Grafana LGTM] and xref:phoenix.adoc[Arize Phoenix], as they all integrate with OpenTelemetry. If more than one of those Dev Services is included in the project dependencies, ensure you only enable one of them via configuration properties (`arconia.dev.services.<name>.enabled`).

== Dependencies

include::partial$dependencies.adoc[]

== Running the Application

include::partial$running-application.adoc[]

By default, when running the application in dev mode, the Dev Service will be shared across multiple applications.

== Exploring the Telemetry

The application logs will show you the URLs where the OpenTelemetry Collector is accepting logs, metrics, and traces.

By default, logs, metrics, and traces are exported via OTLP using the HTTP/Protobuf format.

== Configuring the Dev Service

You can configure the Dev Service via configuration properties.

|===
|Property |Default |Description

|`arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.enabled`
| `true`
| Whether the dev service is enabled.

|`arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.image-name`
| `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`
| Full name of the container image used in the dev service.

|`arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.environment`
| `{}`
| Environment variables to set in the container.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.network-aliases`
| `[]`
| Network aliases to assign to the dev service container.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.port`
| `0`
| Fixed port for exposing the OTLP HTTP port to the host. When it's 0 (default), a random available port is assigned dynamically.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.resources`
| `[]`
| Resources from the classpath or host filesystem to copy into the container. They can be files or directories that will be copied to the specified destination path inside the container at startup and are immutable (read-only).

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.shared`
| `true`
| Whether the dev service is shared among applications. Only applicable in dev mode.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.startup-timeout`
| `120s`
| Maximum waiting time for the service to start.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.volumes`
| `[]`
| Files or directories to mount from the host filesystem into the container. They are mounted at the specified destination path inside the container at startup and are mutable (read-write). Changes in either the host or the container will be immediately reflected in the other.

| `arconia.dev.services.{service-name}.otlp-grpc-port`
| `120s`
| Fixed port for exposing the OTLP gRPC port to the host. When it's 0 (default), a random available port is assigned dynamically.
