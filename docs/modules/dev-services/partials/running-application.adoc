When using the Arconia Dev Services, you can keep running your application as you normally would. The Dev Services will automatically start when you run your application.

NOTE: Unlike the lower-level Testcontainers support in Spring Boot, Arconia doesn't require special tasks to run your application when using Dev Services (`./gradlew bootTestRun` or `./mvnw spring-boot:test-run`) nor requires you to define a separate `@SpringBootApplication` class for configuring Testcontainers.

Your integration tests will automatically use the Dev Services without any additional configuration.
