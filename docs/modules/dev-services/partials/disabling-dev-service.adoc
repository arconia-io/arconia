If you want to disable the Dev Service, you can do so via configuration properties.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
arconia:
  dev:
    services:
      {service-name}:
        enabled: false
----

You can enable/disable the Dev Service for a specific application mode (development, test, production), relying on one of the profiles which are automatically configured by Arconia (see xref:ROOT:core-features/profiles.adoc[Profiles]).

TIP: You can enable/disable the Dev Service for a specific test class by using the `@TestProperty` annotation or equivalent Spring testing utilities.
